To Do: 

1. Restructure IsValid Place so works well with player class??

2. Create a Function in Board manager to count up the point system
    Finished main Points method need to implement the helper
    Helper will:
        Be recursive - BST
            Check for all the neighbors 
                If same type - Remove from the tempDictionary 
                Add all valid neigbors into a tempList
                Add up the crown values of all the valid ^
            If exists iterate through the tempList
                foreach call recursion 
                    - with the currentTile being the currentTile in the iteration
                    - with the tempDictionary being the tempDictionary after the values were removed
            Add up the values of the crown from the return of the iteration
            Replace the old tempDictionary with new if the return is different
            
            Return the new Crown Values and tempDictionary
            
        Return Values:
            Total number of crowns through the tiles that were neighbors and had the same type
            List of ALL tiles that are the same and neighbors ^ coords version of the crown
            tempDictionary
        Parameters
            Current Type of tile we are the function is adding-up/calcing
            Current Tile We are Branching off from 
            tempDictionary that keep tracks of all the Tile that exists but haven't been calc'd yet

3. Write some unit tests for the board
4.
